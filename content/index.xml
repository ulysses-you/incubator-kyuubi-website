KBIPs should be used for significant user-facing or cross-cutting changes, not minor incremental improvements. When in doubt, if a committer thinks a change needs a KBIP, it does.
What is a KBIP? A KBIP is similar to a product requirement document commonly used in product management.</description></item><item><title>Kyuubi Usage</title><link>https://kyuubi.apache.org/usage.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyuubi.apache.org/usage.html</guid><description>Kyuubi provides a pure SQL gateway through Thrift JDBC/ODBC interface for end-users to manipulate large-scale data with pre-programmed and extensible Spark SQL engines.
We are aiming to make Kyuubi an &amp;ldquo;out-of-the-box&amp;rdquo; tool for data warehouses and data lakes.
This &amp;ldquo;out-of-the-box&amp;rdquo; model minimizes the barriers and costs for end-users to use Spark at the client side.
At the server-side, Kyuubi server and engines' multi-tenant architecture provides the administrators a way to achieve computing resource isolation, data security, high availability, high client concurrency, etc.</description></item><item><title>Kyuubi Version Control System</title><link>https://kyuubi.apache.org/version_control.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kyuubi.apache.org/version_control.html</guid><description>Overview The Kyuubi source code resides in the Apache git repository, and available from here: https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=incubator-kyuubi.git

./build/mvn clean package -DskipTests This results in the creation of all sub-modules of Kyuubi project without running any unit test.
If you want to test it manually, you can start Kyuubi directly from the Kyuubi project root by running
bin/kyuubi start Building a Submodule Individually For instance, you can build the Kyuubi Common module using:
