# Debugging Kyuubi

You can use the [Java Debug Wire Protocol](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/conninv.html#Plugin) to debug Kyuubi
with your favorite IDE tool, e.g. IntelliJ IDEA.

## Debugging Server

We can configure the JDWP agent in `KYUUBI_JAVA_OPTS` for debugging.
 
 
For example,
```bash
KYUUBI_JAVA_OPTS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005 \
bin/kyuubi start
```

In the IDE, you set the corresponding parameters(host&port) in debug configurations, for example,
